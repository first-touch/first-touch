          We are a social network and online platform for individuals and organisations who choose to

          Our aim is to drive equality and innovation in the ‘beautiful game’. We want to connect every

          individuals, and the organisations they belong to, to become more productive and successful.
          Our services are designed to create opportunities for established professionals, semi-professionals
          and amateurs, clubs and associations, as well as a variety of service providers by facilitating
          networking, communication, job-searching, hiring, sharing of ideas, learning, discovery,

          <li>
            We may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your listings.
            Such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar
            sold and current listings; results will vary for individual listings. To drive the
            recommendations experience, you agree that we may display the sales and performance history
            of your individual listings to other Users.

          by Visitors. Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or
          information (e.g. sharing to a group instead of your network, changing the default setting for content from public
          to a more restricted view, limiting your profile visibility, or not letting people know when you change your profile,
          make recommendations or follow clubs). Note that other activities, such as applying for a job or sending a direct

            For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically

            transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection

          </li>
          <li>
            When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.

            When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information

          <li>
            When you publish content or information using public settings, it means that you are allowing everyone, including

          information will be truthful. FirstTouch may be required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">9.1 Reading the agreement</h3>
        <p class="section-text"><strong>Here are some important details about how to read the Agreement.</strong></p>
        <p class="section-text">
          If a court with authority over this Agreement finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree
          that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent.
          If the court cannot do that, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and
          still enforce the rest of this Agreement. To the extent allowed by law, the English version of this
          Agreement is binding and other translations are for convenience only. This Agreement (including
          additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the
          only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Agreement, that does not mean that FirstTouch has waived its
          right to enforce this Agreement. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or your membership or use
          of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that FirstTouch may assign this Agreement
          to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.</p>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">9.2 Disclaimer about translating agreement</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          This agreement was written in English (UK). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts
          with the English version, the English version will take precedent.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          To access the User Agreement in several different languages, change the language setting for your FirstTouch
          session by clicking on the language link. If the Agreement is not available in the language you select, we will default to the English version.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">9.3 Modifications</h3>
        <p class="section-text"><strong>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Agreement and will provide you notice if we do and we agree that changes cannot be applied retrospectively. If you don't agree to these changes, you must stop using the Services.</strong></p>
        <ol class="section-text">
          <li>We will notify you before we make changes to these terms and give you the opportunity to review and comment on the revised terms before continuing to use our Services.</li>
          <li>If we make changes to policies, guidelines or other terms referenced in or incorporated by this Agreement, we may provide notice when you next access our Services or update our Services.</li>
          <li>Your continued use of the FirstTouch Services, following notice of the changes to our terms, policies or guidelines, constitutes your acceptance of our amended terms, policies or guidelines.</li>
