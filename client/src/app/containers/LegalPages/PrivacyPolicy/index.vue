                  You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by FirstTouch regarding your
                  profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account. You can request your personal information
                  that is not viewable on your profile or readily accessible to you (for example, your IP access logs) through
                  FirstTouch‘s Help Center. If you close your account, your information will generally be removed from the
                  Service within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information and will de-personalize any logs
                  or other backup information through the deletion process within 30 days of account closure, except as noted
                  below.

                  only, but we generally delete or de-personalize closed account data consistent with Section 3.1., except
                  in the case of our plugin impression data (i.e., the information that you visited on sites carrying our
                  social plugin, but which you did not click on), which we de-personalize within 7 days (although we do maintain
                  30 days worth of webserver logs for security, debugging, and site stability purposes only) by creating
                  aggregate data sets that cannot be traced back to individuals.
