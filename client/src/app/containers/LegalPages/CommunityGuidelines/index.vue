                  FirstTouch aims to put its members first when it comes to their football careers and decision-making. We hope to be the home
                  of many professional and social conversations; a place where insights and advice are shared every day.
                  The FirstTouch Community Standards exist to outline the types of discussions, content and behaviours that
                  are acceptable on FirstTouch, and what may be deemed inappropriate and stopped by FirstTouch. These community
                  standards are intended to provide our members guidance and complement guidelines found in the User Agreement
                  governing your use of, and participation in, FirstTouch’s online services.

                  We believe in the importance of fair play guiding us at all times in all our actions and decisions. Unlike some other online
                  services, our members need to be real people, who provide their real names and accurate information about
                  themselves. It is not okay to provide misleading information about yourself, your football career, your
                  experiences, your qualifications, your affiliations or your achievements on FirstTouch’s service.

                  around professional activities, but we do not want you to use FirstTouch to shock or intimidate others.
                  It is not okay to share graphic images to shock others, and it is not okay to share obscene images or pornography
                  on FirstTouch’s service. FirstTouch is a platform for people who take football seriously and/or want to
                  make a career of it.

                  Governments may also ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not violate our Community Standards. If
